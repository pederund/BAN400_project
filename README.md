# R interface to Avinor flight data

In this project we have collected real time flight data and created a shiny app that visualizes departures and arrivals for Norwegian airports. 
We have separated the process into to scripts. The first, “flight data”, collect the data from Avinor’s own homepage, while the second one creates the app. 
The final product should look something like this:

## Flight Data
### Intallation:
This script depends on some packeges. As the data from Avinor in XML format, we use some packeges that gives us the opportunity to reed this data. To run the script one therefor need to install these:

> install.packeged("")
